    "\n",
    "That long file path is called an **\"absolute path\"**. No matter where you put your code, it will look for a file with that entire path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, use **relative file paths**, which only tells your code where to look _relative_ to the current folder. So, _now_, `clean_data.py` loads `..\\input\\got1.txt`. The `..\\` tells it to look \"one level up\", then inside the input folder.\n",
