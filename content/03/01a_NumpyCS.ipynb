    "- Languages like FORTRAN and C are compiled, and users have to declare that all 10 numbers are numbers, so C code just plows ahead and is done in 9 steps. \n",
    "- It is even worse than that, because in C, the next number in an array is always the same distance from the prior number (in terms of its physical location in memory). Meanwhile, in Python, the program can't quite assume the next number is the same distance away. These \"look ups\" can cause huge delays.\n",
