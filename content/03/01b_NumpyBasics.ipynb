A vector of length `1,000,000,000,000` is huge and requires substantial memory to create. By contrast, you can execute `for i in range(1,000,000,000,000): pass` without causing an issue, because Python **never created that vector, it just iterated over numbers**. This is because `range(#)` is a \"generator\" and not an explicit object. "
